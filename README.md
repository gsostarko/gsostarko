## Who am I?
My name is Goran and I am an electrical engineer who loves to code and learn new stuff. In my free time I make electronics projects (Arduino & ESP32 boards), print stuff on my 3D printer, code, and try to learn new stuff every day. 

## What am I interested in?
I am interested in solving problems with Python (NumPy, Tensorflow, Pandas) in my everyday job. Also I use OpenDSS combined with Python.
